## Introduction

[InsightFace](https://insightface.ai) is an open source 2D&3D deep face analysis toolbox, mainly based on PyTorch and MXNet. 

Please check our [website](https://insightface.ai) for detail.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+** and/or **MXNet=1.6-1.8**, with **Python 3.x**.

InsightFace efficiently implements a rich variety of state of the art algorithms of face recognition, face detection and face alignment, which optimized for both training and deployment.

## Quick Start

Please start with our [python-package](python-package/), for testing detection, recognition and alignment models on input images.

## Face Detection

### Introduction

<div align="left">
  <img src="https://insightface.ai/assets/img/github/11513D05.jpg" width="640"/>
</div>
  RetinaFace is a practical single-stage [SOTA](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/WiderFace_Results.html) face detector which is initially introduced in [arXiv technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641) and then accepted by [CVPR 2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.html). We provide training code, training dataset, pretrained models and evaluation scripts. 

  ![demoimg1](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/resources/11513D05.jpg)

  Please check [RetinaFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/detection/RetinaFace) for detail.

### RetinaFaceAntiCov 

  RetinaFaceAntiCov is an experimental module to identify face boxes with masks. Please check [RetinaFaceAntiCov](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/detection/RetinaFaceAntiCov) for detail.

  ![demoimg1](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/resources/cov_test.jpg)

In this module, we provide training data with annotation, network settings and loss designs for face detection training, evaluation and inference.

The supported methods are as follows:

- [x] [RetinaFace (CVPR'2020)](detection/retinaface)
- [x] [SCRFD (Arxiv'2021)](detection/scrfd)
- [x] [blazeface_paddle](detection/blazeface_paddle)

[RetinaFace](detection/retinaface) is a practical single-stage face detector which is accepted by [CVPR 2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.html). We provide training code, training dataset, pretrained models and evaluation scripts. 

[SCRFD](detection/scrfd) is an efficient high accuracy face detection approach which is initialy described in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04714). We provide an easy-to-use pipeline to train high efficiency face detectors with NAS supporting.


## Face Alignment
  Please check the [Menpo](https://github.com/jiankangdeng/MenpoBenchmark) Benchmark and our [Dense U-Net](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/alignment/heatmapReg) for detail. We also provide other network settings such as classic hourglass. You can find all of training code, training dataset and evaluation scripts there.

### CoordinateReg

  On the other hand, in contrast to heatmap based approaches, we provide some lightweight facial landmark models with fast coordinate regression. The input of these models is loose cropped face image while the output is the direct landmark coordinates. See detail at [alignment-coordinateReg](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/alignment/coordinateReg). Now only pretrained models available.

### Introduction

<div align="left">
  <img src="https://insightface.ai/assets/img/custom/thumb_sdunet.png" width="600"/>
</div>

In this module, we provide datasets and training/inference pipelines for face alignment.

Supported methods:

- [x] [SDUNets (BMVC'2018)](alignment/heatmap)
- [x] [SimpleRegression](alignment/coordinate_reg)


[SDUNets](alignment/heatmap) is a heatmap based method which accepted on [BMVC](http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/0051.pdf).

[SimpleRegression](alignment/coordinate_reg) provides very lightweight facial landmark models with fast coordinate regression. The input of these models is loose cropped face image while the output is the direct landmark coordinates.
